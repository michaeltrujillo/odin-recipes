    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a family recipe that has been developed only over the last 5 years. In this short time it's made me
        famous in our close circle, but until now I've never shared it with anyone.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>⅓ cup soy sauce </li>
        <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>⅓ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>¼ cup Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons dried basil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the soy sauce, olive oil, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, basil, parsley, and pepper
            in a blender. Add hot pepper sauce and garlic, if desired. Blend on high speed for 30 seconds until
            thoroughly mixed.</li>
        <li>Pour marinade over desired type of meat. Cover, and refrigerate for up to 8 hours. Cook meat as desired.
    </ol>
